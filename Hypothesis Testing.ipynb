    "- **Strength and Direction of Correlation:** The Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.453 indicates a moderate negative correlation between sleep disturbances and sleep quality. This means that as sleep disturbances increase (become more frequent), sleep quality tends to decrease (gets worse).\n",

A p-value of 4.2e-07 is extremely small, far below the common alpha level of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance. This means that the negative correlation observed is highly unlikely to be due to random variation in the sample; it's statistically significant.\n",

    "Based on the Spearman correlation test, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between sleep disturbances and sleep quality. The data supports the alternative hypothesis that sleep disturbances do affect sleep quality, with more disturbances associated with worse sleep quality. This result aligns with what might be expected intuitively: that individuals who experience more disturbances during sleep tend to report lower overall sleep quality."

    "The value is approximately 19.30. This statistic measures how much the observed frequencies in the data deviate from the frequencies that would be expected if there were no association between sleep onset time and sleep quality. A higher value typically indicates a stronger departure from the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P-Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is approximately 0.0228, which is lower the common alpha level of 0.05. This indicates that there is a statistically significant association between sleep onset time and sleep quality, although the strength of this association is not as strong as it might be for a much lower p-value.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the p-value of 0.0228, which is less than the alpha level of 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a statistically significant association between sleep onset time and sleep quality in your dataset. The relationship, as indicated by the Chi-squared statistic, is present but not extremely strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should examine the observed frequencies against the expected frequencies to gain insights into the nature of the association. For instance, you might find that certain sleep onset times are more frequently associated with particular levels of sleep quality, indicating patterns that could be of interest for further study or interventions."
