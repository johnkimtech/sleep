    "\n",
    "- **Strength and Direction of Correlation:** The Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.453 indicates a moderate negative correlation between sleep disturbances and sleep quality. This means that as sleep disturbances increase (become more frequent), sleep quality tends to decrease (gets worse).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Significance:** The p-value is a measure of the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance if there were no actual relationship in the population. A p-value of 4.2e-07 is extremely small, far below the common alpha level of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance. This means that the negative correlation observed is highly unlikely to be due to random variation in the sample; it's statistically significant.\n",

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Based on the Spearman correlation test, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between sleep disturbances and sleep quality. The data supports the alternative hypothesis that sleep disturbances do affect sleep quality, with more disturbances associated with worse sleep quality. This result aligns with what might be expected intuitively: that individuals who experience more disturbances during sleep tend to report lower overall sleep quality."
