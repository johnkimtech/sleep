A p-value of 4.2e-07 is extremely small, far below the common alpha level of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance. This means that the negative correlation observed is highly unlikely to be due to random variation in the sample; it's statistically significant.\n",

The data supports the alternative hypothesis that sleep disturbances do affect sleep quality, with more disturbances associated with worse sleep quality.

While there is a weak negative correlation, it is not statistically significant, and therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. It is important to note that this does not necessarily mean there is no relationship at all, but rather that the test did not detect a strong enough relationship in the sample data to assert that one exists in the population."

    "At a significance level of 0.05, our analysis reveals the following noteworthy associations between various factors and sleep quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sleep Disturbance:** We find that an increase in sleep disturbances is linked to a notable deterioration in sleep quality. This suggests that individuals experiencing more sleep disruptions tend to report lower sleep quality, indicating the detrimental impact of such disturbances on overall restorative sleep.\n",
    "* **Age Group and Sleep Duration:** Our statistical analysis delineates a weak yet statistically significant negative correlation between age group and sleep duration. This suggests a tendency for sleep duration to decrease modestly as age increases. Although the correlation is not robust, the trend indicates that older individuals may experience a slight reduction in the amount of sleep they obtain, warranting attention to sleep health in advancing age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sleep Onset Time:** Our analysis indicates that the speed at which an individual falls asleep plays a significant role in determining sleep quality. Specifically, a quicker onset of sleep is associated with a substantial improvement in sleep quality. This implies that individuals who are able to fall asleep more rapidly tend to enjoy a better overall sleep experience in terms of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exercise Weekly Frequency:** Interestingly, our findings do not provide sufficient statistical evidence to support the notion that increasing exercise frequency significantly enhances sleep quality. However, it is worth noting that a correlation exists between higher exercise frequency and extended sleep duration. This suggests that individuals who engage in more frequent exercise routines tend to sleep for longer durations, although the \n",
    "improvement in sleep quality itself remains inconclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nap Duration:** Our examination does not reveal a clear-cut connection between the length of naps and the overall duration of nighttime sleep. The data does not present a compelling case for the hypothesis that longer naps correlate with either an increase or decrease in the total amount of sleep obtained at night. As such, it remains uncertain whether napping habits have a significant impact on the length of nocturnal sleep, warranting further investigation.\n",
